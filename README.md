This machine learning model is designed to help farmers make informed decisions about crop selection, disease prevention, fertilizer application, and market trends. It is based on a deep learning architecture that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze images of leaves and other supervised algorithms to analyze other features.
