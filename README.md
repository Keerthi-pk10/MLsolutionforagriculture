# MLsolutionforagriculture
This machine learning model is designed to help farmers make informed decisions about crop selection, disease prevention, fertilizer application, and market trends. It is based on a deep learning architecture that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze images of leaves and other supervised algorithms to analyze other features.

# What it does ?
This project aims to revolutionize the way we detect diseases in tomato plants.This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately detect diseases in tomato leaves from images.This user-friendly GUI allows users to simply upload an image of a tomato leaf and receive an decently accurate prediction of any disease present. Additionally, our GUI provides remedies for the detected diseases in Kannada, making it accessible to a wider audience in Karnataka.
The importance of staying up-to-date on the market trends of tomato production in today's world is crucial.Therefore, our project also includes a visualization of tomato markets in major cities in Karnataka. This feature provides valuable insights into the tomato industry and helps farmers make informed decisions about their crops.I hope this project will contribute to the agricultural industry and empower farmers in Karnataka to make informed decisions about their crops.I welcome any feedback and contributions to make our project even better!
