# MLsolutionforagriculture
This machine learning model is designed to help farmers make informed decisions about crop selection, disease prevention, fertilizer application, and market trends. It is based on a deep learning architecture that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze images of leaves and other supervised algorithms to analyze other features.

Tomato prices surge as rains damage crop
By Sutanuka Ghosal, ET BureauLast Updated: Aug 12, 2022, 12:53 AM IST

Tomato is an integral part of every household throughout India as it is the basic ingredient of almost every dish in the Indian cuisine.
In recent years, the tomato industry in India has faced a significant challenge in the form of tomato leaf diseases, which have caused immense losses for farmers. According to a report by The Economic Times, farmers in Karnataka alone have reported losses of over Rs 500 crore due to diseases in tomato plants.
This inspired me to create a model that provides a solution that can help farmers detect diseases in tomato plants accurately and quickly remedy it.

# What it does ?
This project aims to revolutionize the way we detect diseases in tomato plants.This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately detect diseases in tomato leaves from images.This user-friendly GUI allows users to simply upload an image of a tomato leaf and receive an decently accurate prediction of any disease present. Additionally, our GUI provides remedies for the detected diseases in Kannada, making it accessible to a wider audience in Karnataka.
The importance of staying up-to-date on the market trends of tomato production in today's world is crucial.Therefore, our project also includes a visualization of tomato markets in major cities in Karnataka. This feature provides valuable insights into the tomato industry and helps farmers make informed decisions about their crops.I hope this project will contribute to the agricultural industry and empower farmers in Karnataka to make informed decisions about their crops.I welcome any feedback and contributions to make our project even better!

# Existing solution :
There are some existing solutions that analyses the image and applies CNN but this is a model that specifically targets the Karnataka farmers and hence provides remedies and solutions accessible by them.
It is also intel oneAPI optimised hence it provides faster,optimised algorithms and computations.
